1. There's still raising smoke
into the soot-blackened sky
over ruins, and I run
through a world of ruins!
Fervency still glows,
between the rocks
I'm still awake
in a world of ruins!

R: World to ashes, world to dust,
I'm walking and I think
I still hear the people's cries!
World to ashes, world to dust,
I'm harkening and I think
the last gladiator still bellows!

2. The sun slowly rises
behind the crimson sky,
hot like fire, and I run
through a world of ruins!
Blood still adheres to the stones
it slowly trickles through the alleys
hot and red, like blood,
in a world of ruins!

R: World to ashes, world to dust,
I'm walking and I think
I still hear the people's cries!
World to ashes, world to dust,
I'm harkening and I think
the last gladiator still bellows!

3. It's still around,
the soldiers are still screaming,
nothing to hold them back,
in a world of ruins!
Will it ever be over?
Will there ever be peace?
I'm still sitting here and crying,
in a world of ruins!

R: World to ashes, world to dust,
I'm walking and I think
I still hear the people's cries!
World to ashes, world to dust,
I'm harkening and I think
the last gladiator still bellows!

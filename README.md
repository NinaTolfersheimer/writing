# Writing
A quick overview over some of my writing, in German and English.

My mother tongue is German, so if you're speaking German, better check out the German originals! 

I've provided a literal translation for every text, though this process obviously destroyed rhymes etc. That's why I'm currently working on translations preserving the texts' measures and stuff, which I'll be occasionaly dropping. Stay tuned ðŸ˜‰

## Available Texts
These texts are provided [in the actual GitHub repo](https://github.com/NinaTolfersheimer/writing):

Underneath The Clouds The Lonely Evening

Underneath the clouds the lonely evening
the sun like blood and the sky like concrete,
the hand is running but is still not moving
burning letters
only expired when the last bird remains silent
and the sun is frozen
heat of the light –
coldness of the suffocating heart.
The rain's acid drops
in the face of the night –
silent. But the wrist quivers
and the tear's border burns
and paints
a nacked – nothing
measured in pH

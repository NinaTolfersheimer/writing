Love, peace, pursuit of freedom,
values of the modern times,
equality between all humans
guide us in eternity!
Humanism, human rights,
undying justice,
these can lift mountains,
and it's loud storm sounds widely!

All the humans would be better of
if they were united globally,
one Earth, one humanity,
one sun which is shining!
Yeah, our lives would be so much more easy
if we knew about that treasure!
One global community,
peace forever, on and on!

The spark leaps from Europe
over into the entire world,
una in diversitate,
unity that eternally holds!
Come all, let us, all together,
now build our One World!
We can watch the stars
when we stand on the highest peak!

We are only strong together,
we are only weak alone,
if we only keep together,
yeah, no one will be able to divide us!
Live, love, breathe, Europe,
enemies will be siblings!
The entirety of Europe convenes
beneath the stars' golden glint!
